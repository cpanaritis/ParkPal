Description	
==================================================	
Our project is to create a park and ride focused commute planner using the Google Maps API and open datasets from the RTM and STM. The main goal is to allow for a user to use one application to track everything and commute safely and quickly, without switching between 4-5 apps. In addition, the application will take advantage of the Uber API and the userâ€™s current location in order to allow users to call for a ride in the event that they cannot make it back to their car via transit. The application is developed for Android, iOS and web.
